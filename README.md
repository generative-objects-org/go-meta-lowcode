# GO-LowCode Platform
GO-LowCode is the open source Low-code Platform initiated by Generative Objects

The GO-LowCode Platform open sourcing is on-progress. At the moment, we are opening the github repository to developers who want to join early and help finalizing what needs to be done to publically open source and give access to all. The public opening is planned for autumn 2020. 

The Licence will be AGPL-3.0 for the GO-LowCode platform and meta-model. However the generated applications are independant from the low-code platform, and will be freely usable as wanted. This means that anyone can use the GO-LowCode technology to create commercial applications. However, if improvments are done to the GO-LowCode platform itself, these will have to be made public.

In the meantime, here are a few resources to explore :
* Motivation and intention for open sourcing GO-LowCode :  https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-open-source-platform-generative-objects/
* GO-LowCode forum, for users of the technology and contributors to the technology : https://forum.generativeobjects.com
* Functionnal and technical presentation of the GO-LowCode platform : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7iM9Z6TGG4
* And Generative Objects web site : https://www.generativeobjects.com

What remains to be done before public opening includes :

* partial rewriting of the code generator
* moving to .NET Core 
* integrating Postgresql
* documentation and quickstart guide
