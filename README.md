Generative Objects Low-code Platform

The Generative Objects Low-code Platform open sourcing is on-progress. At the moment, we are opening the github repository to developers who want to join early and help finalizing what needs to be done to publically open source and give access to all. The public opening is planned for autumn 2020. 

In the meantime, here are a few resources to explore :
* Motivation and intention for open sourcing Generative Objects :  https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-open-source-platform-generative-objects/
* Generative Objects forum, for users of the technology and contributors to the technology : https://forum.generativeobjects.com
* Functionnal and technical presentation of the Generative Objects technology : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7iM9Z6TGG4
* And Generative Objects web site : https://www.generativeobjects.com

What remains to be done before public opening includes :

* partial rewriting of the code generator
* moving to .NET Core 
* integrating Postgresql
* documentation and quickstart guide

If you feel compelled to join early and help, please reach me at me@walteralmeida.com
